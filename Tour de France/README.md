This project is a part o the Maven Analytics Tour de France Challenge.

## Challenge Objective
For the Maven Tour de France Challenge, you'll be playing the role of a Data Visualization Expert at the Amaury Sport Organisation, the company that organizes the annual Tour de France cycling race.
While the Tour de France is one of the most watched live sporting events in the world, most viewership comes from European countries. 
Your goal is to help increase the race's popularity around the world by creating an infographic-style visual to educate new viewers, 
highlight the magnitude of the event, and build anticipation for this year's race.
