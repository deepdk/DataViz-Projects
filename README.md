## 1. [Presidents of India](https://github.com/deepdk/DataViz-Projects/tree/main/Presidents%20of%20India)

On 21 July 2022, Shrimati Droupadi Murmu was elected as the 15th President of India. I decided to take a look at the former Indian Presidents and their terms. The purpose of this Visualization is to create a beautiful visualization in R using ggplot and also learn how to add images to a plot.

The dataset I used in this notebook is scraped from wikipedia.

I scraped the table using R and did a bit of cleaning in excel.
